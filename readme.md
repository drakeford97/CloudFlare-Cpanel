## CloudFlare cPanel Quick Installation Instructions

Using an SSH client such as Terminal or Putty:

Step 1. Access cPanel for the server using root user by:

`ssh root@SERVER IP ADDRESS or SERVER NAME`

Step 2. Download necessary files and run installation

`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudflare/CloudFlare-CPanel/master/cloudflare.install.sh) HOST_API_KEY 'YOUR_COMPANY_NAME' [install_mode]`

NOTES:
- Be sure to replace HOST_API_KEY and YOUR_COMPANY_NAME with the appropriate values
- [install_mode] is optional and needs to be either `simple` or `extended`. Extended is the default version, adding simple to the installer shows only 1 CloudFlare icon in the main cPanel dashboard

### Additional Installation Instructions for custom/additional themes

The CloudFlare plugin is installed into the default 'x3' theme, as well as the new 'Paper Lantern' theme if installed. If you utilize a custom theme or have alternate themes installed, the following command can be used to install the CloudFlare plugin on these themes:

`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudflare/CloudFlare-CPanel/master/copy2theme.sh) BASE_THEME ALTERNATE_THEME`

`BASE_THEME` should be either 'x3' or 'paper_lantern', based on what theme the alternate was based on.

Replace `ALTERNATE_THEME` with the folder name of the alternate theme on your server. This folder should be located at `/usr/local/cpanel/base/frontend/ALTERNATE_THEME/`.

### BETA: "Default on" for accounts added to cPanel servers

For servers that have the CloudFlare plugin installed, server owners can additionally enable a hook to automatically attempt to provision CloudFlare for all new accounts. This script hooks into the Whostmgr::Accounts::Create event.

Once cPanel completes the account creation, the user's information is passed to the "default-on.php" script which attempts to create a CloudFlare account for the email address of the account and add the domain to CloudFlare. If the domain is added, the "www" subdomain will be automatically "orange clouded", enabling CloudFlare on traffic through that sub domain. This process will update the DNS record on that subdomain to properly route traffic.

This service can be enabled by running the following command:

`/usr/local/cpanel/bin/manage_hooks add script /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/cloudflare/default-on.php`

To disable this service, run the same command with "delete" instead of "add":

`/usr/local/cpanel/bin/manage_hooks delete script /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/cloudflare/default-on.php`

Upon successfully completing signup for CloudFlare. The end-user should be able to click the "CloudFlare" button in their cPanel dashboard and already be logged in to the CloudFlare interface to enable additional subdomains, manage CloudFlare settings, and view analytics on their domain.

### Uninstalling the cPanel Plugin

An uninstall script has been provided to unregister the plugin with cPanel and remove all CloudFlare specific files from the server to deactivate the plugin.

NOTE: This will not remove zones or users from CloudFlare that have been registered through the plugin.

The following set of commands will download the necessary files, execute the uninstall script and ultimately remove the uninstall script as well:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudflare/CloudFlare-CPanel/master/cloudflare/installers/cloudflare.cpanelplugin && bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudflare/CloudFlare-CPanel/master/cloudflare/uninstall_cf) && rm -f uninstall_cf`
