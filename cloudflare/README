CloudFlare plugin for CPanel.

Requires:

Provides access to the CloudFlare service. Learn more about CloudFlare at cloudflare.com.

First, acquire a host api key from CloudFlare. 

Install (as root):

./install_cf HOST_API_KEY [mod_cf]

This works for the default theme and locale. Other themes or locales may require custom work. 
Replace HOST_API_KEY with your api key. Adding the string mod_cf will also install the Apache 
extension mod_cloudflare on the local server. More information is available here: 
https://github.com/cloudflare/CloudFlare-Tools.

Edit API key:

If you need to, update your API key by editing the file /usr/local/cpanel/etc/cloudflare.json, updating 
the value host_key.

Edit CloudFlare prefix:

After having been routed through the CloudFlare network, if the traffic is clean and cannot be handled by 
the CloudFlare cache, it will be relayed to a single given subdomain. Be default, this is 
cloudflare-resolve-to.example.com (replacing example.com with each user's domain). 
If you wish to change the subdomain, edit the file /usr/local/cpanel/etc/cloudflare.json, 
changing the value of the host_prefix key to the desired subdomain. This subdomain will be 
automatically added to each user's zone file.

Uninstall: 

/usr/local/cpanel/bin/unregister_cpanelplugin <full path to install file cloudflare.cpanelplugin>
