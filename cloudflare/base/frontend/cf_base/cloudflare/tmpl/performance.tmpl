		<h4>Next-generation CDN</h4>
		<p>CloudFlare designed its CDN (Content Delivery Network) without the legacy of the last 15 years. Our proprietary technology takes advantage of recent changes to hardware, web server technology and network routing. In other words, we’ve built the next-generation CDN. The result is a CDN that is easier to setup, more affordable, and performs better than any legacy CDN you've tried before.</p>

		<h4>Web content optimization</h4>

		<p>Web performance is not just about moving static files closer to visitors, it is also about ensuring that every page renders as fast and efficiently as possible from whatever device a visitor is surfing from. CloudFlare users can choose any combination of these web content optimization features that take performance to the next level.</p>

<h4>Dynamic acceleration (select hosts)</h4>
<p>
    (Note: Your hosting provider needs to be an approved CloudFlare Optimized Partner in order to provide you with Railgun, the CloudFlare dynamic content accelerator.)
</p>
<p>
    CloudFlare Railgun ensures that the connection between your origin server and the CloudFlare network is as fast as possible. Railgun achieves a 99.6% compression ratio for previously uncacheable web objects by using techniques similar to those used in the compression of high-quality video. This results in an average 200% additional performance increase. Learn more at <A href="http://www.cloudflare.com/railgun" target=_blank">www.cloudflare.com/railgun</a>.

<!-- TODO: integrate a check for whether the host supports railgun -->
<div class="hide">
    <p>
        [if the host does support Railgun] HOST NAME has made Railgun available for your account. Enable Railgun in your settings below for each domain.
    </p>
    <p>
        [If the host doesn’t support Railgun] HOST NAME does not appear to be a CloudFlare Optimized Partner. They need to be an approved Optimized Partner in order to make Railgun available to you. You can either contact HOST NAME’s support and encourage them to offer Railgun or purchase a CloudFlare plan supporting Railgun. Your host can inquire at www.cloudflare.com/partners.
